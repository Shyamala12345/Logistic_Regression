# Logistic_Regression:
Logistic regression is a statistical analysis approach that predicts a data value based on previous observations from a data collection. The method enables a Machine Learning system to categorize input data based on past data. The system should improve its ability to anticipate classes within data sets as more relevant data is received. During the extract, transform and load process, logistic regression can help with data preparation by allowing data sets to be placed into specified buckets to stage data for analysis. A logistic regression model analyses the connection between one or more existing independent variables to determine a dependent data variable.
Logistic Regression is broadly of three types:
1. Binary
2. Multinomial
3. Ordinal.
In Machine Learning, Logistic Regression is a supervised method of learning used for predicting the probability of a dependent or a target variable. Using Logistic Regression, you can predict and establish relationships between dependent and one or more independent variables.

 Logistic Regression equations and models are generally used for predictive analytics for binary classification. You can also use them for multi-class classification.
